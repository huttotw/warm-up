# warm-up

Warm up is a pseudo implementation of `golang.org/x/time/rate` with the biggest difference being that you can supply a
custom function with which to calculate the rate at every token. Please see the [Golang documentation](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/time/rate) for details on the
terminology used here, especially _Limiter_, _tokens_, and _bucket_.

### Use cases:
- Sending lots of requests to a system, but you want to give the system a chance to auto-scale.
- Warming up a load balancer to be ready to handle a lot of requests.
- Gradually increasing load to a system.

## Example
```go
func main() {
	fmt.Println("starting...")

	// Define our custom function
	f := func(x float64) float64 {
		return math.Pow(x/10, 2)
	}

	// Create a new limiter that will increase in throughput according to (x/10)^2,
	// with a burst up to 0 tokens.
	l := warmup.NewLimiter(f, 0)

	i := 0
	for {
		ctx := context.Background()
		l.WaitN(ctx, 1)
		fmt.Println("i", i)
		i++
	}
}
```

This example will print out at each iteration, slowly increasing over time.
